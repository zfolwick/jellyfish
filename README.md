# Jellyfish Electronic Control Module

This project is designed to use an arduino to read from sensors, log the sensor data to a file, and act on the results of those sensors. This is a framework design intended to be extended to more complicated systems.

# Running tests
```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle exec arduino_ci_remote.rb
